When running the `fakepermissions` command you will be asked to provide a permission, for example: `,fakepermissions @Moderator manage_nicknames`

<Warning>
This command only allows users to bypass permission checks within **Cypher**. It does not grant the actual Discord permission. For example, if a moderator is given the `ban_members` permission through fake permissions, they can only ban users using the `.ban` command via **Cypher** â€” not through other bots or the Discord client.
</Warning>
