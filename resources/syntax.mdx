# Formatting a Duration

Some commands require a `duration` parameter, which should be written as a number followed by a time unit.  
Here are the supported units:

- `s` – seconds  
- `m` – minutes  
- `h` – hours  
- `d` – days  
- `w` – weeks

For example, `1d` means **1 day**, and `1w` means **1 week**.

```txt
Syntax: .mute (member) (duration) (reason)
Example: .mute @encrypted 1d racism
```
