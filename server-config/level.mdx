# Getting started
XP counting is already enabled in this server, If you want to disable it, run the `level config toggle` command.
You can run the same command again to enable it back.

# Ignoring channels and roles

Donâ€™t want certain channels or roles to gain XP?
Use the levels ignore command to stop XP from being tracked in specific places. Itâ€™s a good idea to set this up right away if needed.

<Info>
Changed your mind? Just run the same command again to stop ignoring a channel or role.
Want to see whatâ€™s currently ignored? Use `level ignore list` to check all ignored channels and roles.

With role stacking enabled (which it is by default), users will keep every role they've earned as they level up â€” not just the one for their current level.

# Customizing level-up messages
You can personalize the level-up message that gets sent whenever someone reaches a new level. Make it your own with a custom touch!
