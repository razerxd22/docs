# Setting up jail

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configuring Jail">
    - Use the `.jailsetup` command in any channel.<br />
    - This will automatically create a `jail` channel, a category named `cypher mod`, and a `jail-logs` channel.<br />
    - You can rename these channels later to fit your preferences.
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Jailing users

<Steps>
  <Step title="Jailing a User">
    - Use the command `.jail (user)`, for example: `.jail @encrypted`.<br />
    - This command will mute the user in all channels except the `jail` channel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Unjailing a User">
    - Use the command `.unjail (user)`, for example: `.unjail @encrypted`.<br />
    - This command will remove the restrictions and restore the user's access.
  </Step>
