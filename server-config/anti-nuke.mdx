## Why use an antinuke system?

It's important to have an antinuke system in place to prevent moderators from abusing their permissions. This is a security measure which lets your server stay safe from any harmful actions.


### How does the antinuke work?


The antinuke system will prevent unwhitelisted members from making potentially harmful changes to your server. Any unauthorized attempts to modify server settings will result in immediate action against the responsible user.
